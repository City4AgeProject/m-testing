The version 1 of the e-testing tool, developed as native mobile application (m-testing tool).
It fulfils the primary purpose of e-testing in City4Age - to create an environment that can gather direct real-time on-site data 
and explicit feedback on activities performed by the care recipients (elderly under observation), structured according to City4Age 
defined and adopted data models and dictionaries. 
The elderly CR user is provided with main functionality to explicitly select the type of Activity he/she is performing at the time, 
start (and stop) the capture of Activity, with timing. While the Activity is performed and captured/recorded by the tool, all the relevant 
mobile device peripherals are forcedly turned on (location service, sensors, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, â€¦) and relaying all available sensory data 
in real-time to the back-end service, to be eventually stored in the City4Age unified data repository.
